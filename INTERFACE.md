# User Interface

We will provide a simple web UI, offering the user to record either a new bag or brew settings. Selecting either will open a mobile friendly form for the user to input the various metadata fields. Upon accepting the input, we will push a UI element to a scrollable 'timeline'.

In our UI, we will use intentional iconography to distinguish various concepts, including morning/day/night icons, and potentially weather iconography to add a sense of personality to our design.

## Accessibility

We will offer a drop down language selection menu, and attempt translations for the major european and asian langauges
